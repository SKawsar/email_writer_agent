    "# How to Automate Cold-Email Outreach with LLM Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Automate Cold Emails?\n",
    "<br>Sending effective, personalized cold emails is time-consuming:\n",
    "- You want variants of professional, witty, or concise emails to A/B test.\n",
    "- You must pick the best draft, not just any draft.\n",
    "- You need compelling subject lines.\n",
    "- You have to convert text to HTML so it renders nicely.\n",
    "- Finally, you still need to deliver via an Email Service Provider like SendGrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "A modern agent framework lets each of these steps become an agent or tool. We simply orchestrate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install these packages:\n",
    "<br>`pip install sendgrid openai-agents`\n",
    "\n",
    "- sendgrid – handles SMTP-class deliverability with minimal fuss.\n",
    "- openai-agents – lets us compose “agents” (LLM instances + instructions + tools) into directed workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then load API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, SENDGRID_API_KEY) and email addresses (SENDER_EMAIL, RECEIVER_EMAIL) from a .env file, keeping secrets out of source control."
